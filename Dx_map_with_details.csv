1st degree av block,270492004,IAVB,"First-degree atrioventricular (AV) block is a type of heart block where the electrical conduction between the atria and the ventricles is delayed. This delay is consistent, and every atrial impulse is conducted to the ventricles, but with a prolonged PR interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG). 

The delay in conduction is usually at the level of the AV node, resulting in a lengthened PR interval on the ECG, but all the atrial impulses eventually reach the ventricles.

While first-degree AV block is often asymptomatic and benign, it can sometimes be associated with conditions such as coronary artery disease, myocarditis, or medications that affect the conduction system of the heart.",https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/atrioventricular-av-block
2nd degree av block,195042002,IIAVB,"Second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block is a type of heart block where some of the electrical impulses from the atria fail to reach the ventricles, leading to intermittent disruption of the conduction between the atria and the ventricles. This results in a dropped beat on the electrocardiogram (ECG), with a pattern of occasional non-conducted P waves.

There are two types of second-degree AV block. Type 1, also known as Wenckebach or Mobitz I, is characterized by a progressively lengthening PR interval until a beat is dropped. Type 2, or Mobitz II, is characterized by a constant PR interval with occasional dropped beats without progressive lengthening.

Second-degree AV block can be associated with various underlying conditions such as myocardial infarction, myocarditis, Lyme disease, and certain medications affecting the conduction system.",https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/atrioventricular-av-block
abnormal QRS,164951009,abQRS,"The QRS complex is a portion of the electrocardiogram (ECG) that represents the depolarization of the ventricles. An abnormal QRS complex may indicate various cardiac conditions or abnormalities. Changes in the QRS complex can be caused by issues such as electrolyte imbalances, cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, conduction abnormalities, or structural heart disease. Abnormalities in the QRS complex can manifest as widened or narrowed QRS complexes, changes in the amplitude, or the presence of abnormal Q waves, among other indicators. These changes can provide valuable insights into the functioning of the heart and assist in diagnosing specific cardiac conditions.",https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/diagnosing-a-heart-attack/electrocardiogram-ecg
accelerated junctional rhythm,426664006,AJR,"Accelerated junctional rhythm is a type of cardiac arrhythmia characterized by the accelerated firing of the atrioventricular (AV) junctional tissue, leading to a heart rate ranging from 60 to 100 beats per minute. In this rhythm, the electrical impulses in the heart originate from the AV node or the surrounding tissue, bypassing the normal pathway of the heart's electrical system. This condition can result from various factors, such as digitalis toxicity, ischemic heart disease, or electrolyte imbalances, and can sometimes occur without any identifiable cause. Although it can be asymptomatic, it may lead to symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, or fainting, depending on the underlying health of the individual.
