1st degree av block,270492004,IAVB,"First-degree atrioventricular (AV) block is a type of heart block where the electrical conduction between the atria and the ventricles is delayed. This delay is consistent, and every atrial impulse is conducted to the ventricles, but with a prolonged PR interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG). 

The delay in conduction is usually at the level of the AV node, resulting in a lengthened PR interval on the ECG, but all the atrial impulses eventually reach the ventricles.

While first-degree AV block is often asymptomatic and benign, it can sometimes be associated with conditions such as coronary artery disease, myocarditis, or medications that affect the conduction system of the heart.",https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/atrioventricular-av-block
2nd degree av block,195042002,IIAVB,"Second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block is a type of heart block where some of the electrical impulses from the atria fail to reach the ventricles, leading to intermittent disruption of the conduction between the atria and the ventricles. This results in a dropped beat on the electrocardiogram (ECG), with a pattern of occasional non-conducted P waves.

There are two types of second-degree AV block. Type 1, also known as Wenckebach or Mobitz I, is characterized by a progressively lengthening PR interval until a beat is dropped. Type 2, or Mobitz II, is characterized by a constant PR interval with occasional dropped beats without progressive lengthening.

Second-degree AV block can be associated with various underlying conditions such as myocardial infarction, myocarditis, Lyme disease, and certain medications affecting the conduction system.",https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/atrioventricular-av-block
abnormal QRS,164951009,abQRS,"The QRS complex is a portion of the electrocardiogram (ECG) that represents the depolarization of the ventricles. An abnormal QRS complex may indicate various cardiac conditions or abnormalities. Changes in the QRS complex can be caused by issues such as electrolyte imbalances, cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, conduction abnormalities, or structural heart disease. Abnormalities in the QRS complex can manifest as widened or narrowed QRS complexes, changes in the amplitude, or the presence of abnormal Q waves, among other indicators. These changes can provide valuable insights into the functioning of the heart and assist in diagnosing specific cardiac conditions.",https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/diagnosing-a-heart-attack/electrocardiogram-ecg
accelerated junctional rhythm,426664006,AJR,"Accelerated junctional rhythm is a type of cardiac arrhythmia characterized by the accelerated firing of the atrioventricular (AV) junctional tissue, leading to a heart rate ranging from 60 to 100 beats per minute. In this rhythm, the electrical impulses in the heart originate from the AV node or the surrounding tissue, bypassing the normal pathway of the heart's electrical system. This condition can result from various factors, such as digitalis toxicity, ischemic heart disease, or electrolyte imbalances, and can sometimes occur without any identifiable cause. Although it can be asymptomatic, it may lead to symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, or fainting, depending on the underlying health of the individual. It is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and management.",https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/accelerated-junctional-rhythm/
acute myocardial infarction,57054005,AMI,"Acute myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when there is a sudden blockage of blood flow to a part of the heart muscle, leading to tissue damage or cell death due to a lack of oxygen. This critical condition often manifests with symptoms such as chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, lightheadedness, or cold sweats. Prompt medical attention is crucial to minimize the extent of damage and improve the chances of survival. Treatments may include medications, interventions like angioplasty or stent placement, or, in severe cases, coronary artery bypass surgery. Lifestyle changes and cardiac rehabilitation are typically recommended post-treatment to prevent future cardiovascular events.",https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack
acute myocardial ischemia,413444003,AMIs,"Acute myocardial ischemia refers to a sudden decrease in blood flow to the heart muscle, leading to an insufficient oxygen supply to meet the heart's demands. This condition can result from various factors, including the narrowing of coronary arteries due to atherosclerosis, coronary artery spasm, or blood clots. The insufficient blood flow can cause chest pain or discomfort, known as angina, and if left untreated, it can progress to a heart attack. Immediate medical attention is crucial to restore blood flow and prevent further damage. Treatments may include medications, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, invasive procedures like angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting.",https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/angina-chest-pain
anterior ischemia,426434006,AnMIs,"Anterior ischemia refers to a condition where the front part of the heart muscle does not receive an adequate blood supply, leading to reduced oxygen delivery to this specific area. It can result from the narrowing or blockage of the left anterior descending artery, one of the main coronary arteries supplying blood to the heart. Common symptoms associated with anterior ischemia may include chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, and fatigue, among others. Prompt medical evaluation is essential to determine the underlying cause and to initiate appropriate treatment. Management typically involves a combination of medications, lifestyle modifications, and, in some cases, revascularization procedures to restore blood flow to the affected area.",https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/angina-chest-pain
anterior myocardial infarction,54329005,AnMI,"Anterior myocardial infarction is a specific type of heart attack that occurs when there is a blockage in the blood supply to the front part of the heart, typically affecting the left ventricle. This critical condition can lead to severe damage to the heart muscle, potentially resulting in life-threatening complications. Common symptoms associated with anterior myocardial infarction include sudden and intense chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, and lightheadedness. Immediate medical intervention is crucial to restore blood flow and minimize the extent of heart muscle damage. Treatments may include medications, interventions like angioplasty or stent placement, and cardiac rehabilitation programs to support recovery and prevent future cardiovascular events.",https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack
atrial bigeminy,251173003,AB,"Atrial bigeminy is a specific cardiac arrhythmia characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the heart, resulting in a pattern where every normal heartbeat is followed by a premature atrial contraction. This irregular rhythm can create a sensation of a skipped heartbeat or palpitations. While it may not always cause significant symptoms, it can sometimes lead to feelings of fluttering in the chest or discomfort. Atrial bigeminy can be associated with various factors, including excessive stress, stimulants, electrolyte imbalances, or certain heart conditions. Monitoring and, if necessary, consultation with a healthcare professional are recommended to evaluate the underlying cause and determine the appropriate management approach.",https://www.heartrhythmalliance.org/aa/us/bigeminy
atrial fibrillation,164889003,AF,"Atrial fibrillation is a common type of cardiac arrhythmia characterized by an irregular and often rapid heartbeat. During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (the atria) quiver instead of beating effectively, leading to inefficient blood pumping. This condition can result in various symptoms, including palpitations, shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue. Atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of complications such as stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related complications. Treatment options may include medications to control heart rate and rhythm, blood thinners to reduce the risk of stroke, and in some cases, procedures like cardioversion or catheter ablation to restore normal heart rhythm.",https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation
