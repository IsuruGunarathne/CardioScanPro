1st degree av block,270492004,IAVB,"First-degree atrioventricular (AV) block is a type of heart block where the electrical conduction between the atria and the ventricles is delayed. This delay is consistent, and every atrial impulse is conducted to the ventricles, but with a prolonged PR interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG). 

The delay in conduction is usually at the level of the AV node, resulting in a lengthened PR interval on the ECG, but all the atrial impulses eventually reach the ventricles.

While first-degree AV block is often asymptomatic and benign, it can sometimes be associated with conditions such as coronary artery disease, myocarditis, or medications that affect the conduction system of the heart.",https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/atrioventricular-av-block

There are two types of second-degree AV block. Type 1, also known as Wenckebach or Mobitz I, is characterized by a progressively lengthening PR interval until a beat is dropped. Type 2, or Mobitz II, is characterized by a constant PR interval with occasional dropped beats without progressive lengthening.
